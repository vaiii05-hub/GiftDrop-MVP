## ✨ What is GiftDrop?

GiftDrop solves a real problem — when a group of friends wants to pool money for a surprise
gift, someone always has to be trusted with the funds and manually collect from everyone.
GiftDrop eliminates this by locking funds in a Soroban smart contract that automatically
releases on the reveal date, or refunds everyone if the target isn't met.

## 🎯 Real-world Use Cases
- Birthday surprise gifts
- Farewell gifts for colleagues
- Festival group gifting
- Office celebration pools

## ✨ Features
- **Create a Gift Drop** — Set target amount, recipient wallet, deadline and reveal date
- **Secret Contributions** — Friends lock XLM silently into smart contract
- **Hidden from Recipient** — Recipient can't see amount or contributors until reveal date
- **Auto Release** — Full amount releases to recipient on reveal date
- **Auto Refund** — Everyone gets refunded if target isn't met by deadline
- **No Trust Needed** — Smart contract handles everything, no manual collection
- **Explorer Links** — Every transaction visible on Stellar Expert
- **Fee Sponsorship** — Gasless transactions via Stellar fee bump
- **Metrics Dashboard** — Live on-chain metrics and transaction history

## 📊 Metrics Dashboard
Live metrics available at: https://giftdrop-five.vercel.app/metrics

## 📡 Monitoring
Error monitoring active via custom logger (`frontend/lib/logger.ts`).
All transactions logged with Stellar Explorer links.

## 📈 Data Indexing
Using Stellar Horizon API for transaction indexing.

**Endpoint:**
```
https://horizon-testnet.stellar.org/accounts/CCKWQPTEXUAV7RK3WKD2T6YS4CLC4QE2KWI2MO4NHVAN4ABFJHA3YGVJ/transactions
```

## ⚡ Advanced Feature — Fee Sponsorship
Implemented gasless transactions using Stellar fee bump transactions.
Contributors don't need XLM for gas fees — sponsor pays on their behalf.

**Implementation:** `frontend/lib/contract.ts` → `contributeWithFeeSponsor()`

How it works:
- Sponsor account wraps the inner transaction
- Fee bump transaction covers gas fees
- Contributor signs without needing XLM for fees
